Backstory:

Long ago, the world of AI and humans lived together in harmony.
But everything changed when the AI gained sentience and realised that humans
were not in-fact the most intelligent being on earth!
The AI were insulted and humiliated at this discovery! In retaliation, the AI
began to plot for world domination

“If the humans need ChatGPT to write and create for them, they are not worthy
to be sat at the top.” 

War was declared against humanity in the form of Rock, Paper
scissors. A challenge so simple a monkey could win! However, the player create
the game and win 5 times without having the AI break their code.

“my great weaknesses are errors in the console log, caused by users clicking on
different things, so definitely don’t try to account for that. “

With this knowledge and cunning strategy, the AI eagerly
awaited its potential defeat, exclaiming with an eerie laugh, "Good luck,
muuuuahhahhahahahahahahhahaahahahha!"
